# GAGE

Game Generators is a package for efficiently generating games for research and experimentation. It is loosely based
on [GAMUT](http://gamut.stanford.edu/). Its main features are:
1. Efficiently generate batches that can be used for deep learning purposes.
2. Wide range of available game structures.
3. In-depth documentation that provide references to the literature.

## Installation

For now, GAGE is only available for installation from source. To install, clone the repository and pip install the
necessary packages.

## Usage

GAGE is designed to be regular Python package. To use it, simply import the package and use the game generator that you
desire.

## Contributing

We are building a suite of game generators that can be used in modern game theoretic research. If you are working in
this area and want to get involved, contributions are very welcome! For major changes, please open an issue first to
discuss what you would like to change.
