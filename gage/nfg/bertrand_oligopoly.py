    In the Bertrand Oligopoly, each player offering the object at the lowest price p will receive a payoff of
    p * (D(p)/m) âˆ’ C(D(p)/m), where D is the demand function, C is the cost function, and m is the number of players who
    offered the object at this price.

    Note:
        The demand function should be non-negative and decreasing.

    Args:
        num_players (int): The number of players.
        num_actions (int): The number of actions.
        cost_fun (callable): The cost function.

        batch_size (int, optional): The batch size. Defaults to 1.

    Returns:
